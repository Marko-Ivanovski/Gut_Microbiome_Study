# Gut Microbiome Project

This project investigates the relationship between the human gut microbiome and health by applying machine learning techniques to microbiome taxonomy data. The goal was to classify individuals as Healthy, Crohnâ€™s Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, or Obese based on the bacterial composition in their stomach. The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development using different classification models. The results demonstrate that microbiome composition can be a meaningful predictor of health conditions, with Random Forest and XGBoost showing the most promising performance. 

Future improvements could involve experimenting with deep learning approaches, refining feature selection, and potentially expanding the work into a research paper.
